#  90 Days DevOps & Cloud Learning Plan

## Current Level
- Software Engineer (11 months experience )
- Working Professional (IT Background)

---

## My Understanding of DevOps & Cloud Engineering
DevOps is a combination of **Development (Dev)** and **Operations (Ops)**.  
In real companies, there is often confusion, project delivery delays, and blame between dev and ops teams.

DevOps helps to:
- Reduce this confusion
- Improve collaboration
- Automate build, test, deploy, and monitoring processes
- Deliver software faster and more reliably
---

## Why I’m Learning DevOps & Cloud
- I explored many tools and technologies but felt **stuck**
- DevOps connected everything I had learned before
- I want to understand **how real systems work in production**
---

## Where I Want to Reach
- Become **strong and confident** in DevOps-related technologies
- Build skills so solid that **no one can question my capability**
- Apply DevOps not only in work, but also in **real-life problem-solving**
- Grow as a reliable, disciplined engineer

---

##  Core DevOps Skills I Will Build
-  Linux & Shell Scripting  
-  Networking Fundamentals  
-  Git & GitHub  
-  Docker & Containers  
-  CI/CD Automation (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)  
-  Cloud & Kubernetes (Scaling & Orchestration)  
-  Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Ansible)  
-  Observability & Reliability (Grafana, Prometheus)

---

##  Time Commitment & Consistency Plan
- Weekdays: **5 hours/day**
- Weekends: **11 hours/day**
- Focus more on **hands-on labs & projects**, not only theory
- Rule: **Every day is a  grind day**

---

## How I Will Stay Consistent
- Started **#90DaysOfDevOps** challenge
- Daily learning → Daily sharing on LinkedIn
- Even small progress will be shared
- Learning in public to build discipline

---

## 🤝 90-Day Commitment
For the next 90 days, I commit to learning DevOps with discipline, practicing daily, building real projects, and sharing my journey publicly to become a better engineer every day.
