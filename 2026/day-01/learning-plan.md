# ✈️ 90 Days DevOps & Cloud Learning Plan

## 👤 Current Level
- Software Engineer (11 months experience )
- Working Professional (IT Background)
- Beginner → Intermediate journey in DevOps

## 🧠 My Understanding of DevOps & Cloud Engineering
DevOps is a combination of **Development (Dev)** and **Operations (Ops)**.  
In real companies, there is often confusion, project delivery delays, and blame between dev and ops teams.

DevOps helps to:
- Reduce this confusion
- Improve collaboration
- Automate build, test, deploy, and monitoring processes
- Deliver software faster and more reliably

## ❓ Why I’m Learning DevOps & Cloud
- I explored many tools and technologies but felt **stuck**
- DevOps connected everything I had learned before
- I want to understand **how real systems work in production**
---

## 🎯 Where I Want to Reach
- Become **strong and confident** in DevOps-related technologies
- Build skills so solid that **no one can question my capability**
- Apply DevOps not only in work, but also in **real-life problem-solving**
- Grow as a reliable, disciplined engineer
